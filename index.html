<p></p>This page is all about crafting, scrapbooking and creating. ScrappyHappyCrafts is a local business that specializes in greeting cards/mini albums/scrapbooks/layouts/wall hangings/any 3D Paper goods projects/etc. It can be birthday/anniversary/baby shower/baby girl/baby boy/thank you/sorry/festive cards/albums, whatever you think of, I can create.
My style is Shabby chic and Vintage. I love all the Pastel colour shades. Creating is not just my hobby but my passion and this keeps me going all the way to achieve my goalsgit
